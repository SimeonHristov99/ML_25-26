# Machine Learning and Data Mining, Winter Semester 2025-2026

## 🧭 Course Values

1. **Collaborate To Win**: work as one united team and use your combined strengths and capabilities to learn as much as possible.
2. **Innovate To Grow**: be proactive - it's the responsibility of each one of us to find opportunities and improve the course and each other. I give feedback to you, you share feedback between each other, you give feedback to me.
3. **Delight Viewers**: publish what you've learned in social platforms, build eye-catching solutions with the intention of showing your work to future customers/recruiters.
4. **Safeguard Our Future**: if you feel you're treated unfairly or you want to discuss any other problem, don't wait - talk to me directly.
5. **Value Each Other**: treat each other (and me) with respect, trust and integrity. The people that surround you now, might be your future colleagues. Act as if your actions have eternal consequences.
6. **You Learn As Much As You Want**: take full responsibility for the authenticity of your code! If you cannot write it on your own, let's write it together. You're not expected to solve everything - solve as much as you like and together we'll solve the rest.

## 📘 Set up an environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts

Please follow the instructions in one of the following two folders:

1. [GuideForVisualStudioCode](./GuideForVisualStudioCode/) - for working in a local development environment (**recommended**).
2. [GuideForGoogleColab](./GuideForGoogleColab/) - for working using a remote Google Cloud session.

## 💡 Don't be afraid to ask questions 😊

> He who asks a question is a fool **for five minutes**; he who does not ask a question remains a fool **forever**.

-- Chinese Proverb

## 💬❓ Frequently asked questions

### How will I be graded?

There will be two homeworks ($20$% of grade in total), a project ($30$% of grade) and a theoretical discussion ($50$% of the grade). There will be no exams.

### Can I submit my own project idea?

Yes. I'll let you know when there's a submission form for that. Note that in order for you to start working on your idea, it has to be approved by me.

### What is "the discussion"?

- The discussion is done after the defense of the project on the date of the final exam.
- It forms **50%** of the final grade.
- If I'm available to tune in for the final, I'll be asking questions (some will be in an interview style) regarding the topics I've covered.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me everything you know about boosting?
  - How can we deal with missing values?
  - What's an important step to do when splitting data for a classification problem?
- The complexity of the questions will be inversely proportional to the number of submitted `For Home` weeks. More submissions => easier questions (from my side).
  - I'll ask no questions if all `For Home` weeks are submitted.

### What is `For Home`?

`For Home` is a system having the only goal of making sure you understand what we discuss and do in class.

Its essence:

- curated tasks that are present in every practice session;
- you solve them whenever you want to and have free time. We'll try to solve as many of them in class, in teams;
- you submit them before the next session over email. Make sure to elaborate which tasks you solved in class;
- I check your solutions and give either a `Yes` or feedback on what I would like us to work on;
- (iteration) you implement the feedback and submit again. I check and provide either `Yes` or feedback on what I would like us to work on;
- you reap the benefits the system provides: a maximum of $2$ point increase for each homework, the project and the discussion.

The most important characteristic of `For Home` is **iterative feedback**. Its goal is **not** to be a one-time-submission. It's goal is to help you learn via **iterative feedback**.

> **Note:** You cannot submit `For Home` for week `n + i, i > 0`, if week `n` is not approved with `Yes`.

### How to submit `For Home`?

Only over email, using the already established email thread in the beginning of the course (see the `Announcement` in `Moodle`).

### Which version of Python are we using?

Python 3.12.3
